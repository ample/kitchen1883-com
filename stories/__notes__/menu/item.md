# Menu Item

The MenuSection component renders a single food item's title, description, price, and dietary icons.

It can receive five props:

- `label`: A required string for the food name, created by the CMS
- `body`: A string prop for the description, created by the CMS
- `price`: A string prop for the price, created by the CMS
- `vegetarian` & `gluten_free`: Boolean props where `true` adds a dietary icon, created by the CMS

## Knobs

There are story knobs to test the contents of all five props.

## Usage

This component is generated by `MenuSection`.

```jsx
<MenuItem label={} price={} body={} vegetarian={} gluten_free={} />
```
