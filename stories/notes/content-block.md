# Content Block

Content blocks control most of the flexible content areas of the site. They
support 1-4 blocks, where each block can be plain text with or without a
background color or image.

The `<ContentBlock />` component supports a single (required) property, `data`,
which should be an array of blocks, even if there is only one block.
